canvas-particle-shape
=====================

This is a simple HTML5 canvas visualization that makes particles follow a shape. The shape is easy to define using the `shape(t)` function, and the example is using ´y=sin(x)´.

The user can interact with the particles using the mouse or a touch screen, e.g. a mobile device.
